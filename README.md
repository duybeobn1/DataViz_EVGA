## 🌍 Description
This data visualization explores how **energy consumption**, **climate conditions**, and **water efficiency (WUE)** interact in **data centers across Africa**.  
It aims to reveal how different **climate regions** and **energy mixes** (renewables vs. fossil fuels) impact the **water footprint** of data centers and AI infrastructure.

Through interactive D3.js visualizations, the project highlights:
- Which countries consume the most electricity,
- How their water usage efficiency compares,
- The influence of temperature, humidity, and leakages on performance.

---

## 🧠 Goals
- Understand the environmental impact of AI computing and data centers in Africa.  
- Promote awareness about sustainable water management in the energy and tech sectors.  
- Provide an educational and policy-oriented visualization accessible to the public.

---

## 🧰 Tech stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Visualization:** D3.js v7  
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (.io)

## 📊 Visualizations
1. **Map of Africa:** Energy consumption intensity (Total Energy – TWh), with tooltip showing the national energy mix.  
2. **Scatterplot:** Relationship between renewables share and indirect water usage efficiency (WUE Indirect).  
3. **Boxplot:** Cooling water efficiency (WUE Direct) by climate region.  
4. **Bar chart:** Water losses due to leakages per country.
