# 📈 Project Progress Log – Water Efficiency of African Data Centers  

## Week 1: Dataset Selection & Topic Definition  
- Chosen dataset: [Water Efficiency Dataset for African Data Centers](https://huggingface.co/datasets/masterlion/WaterEfficientDatasetForAfricanCountries).  
- Explored dataset structure and validated variables (weather, energy, water efficiency).  
- Brainstormed visualization goals → focus on **energy consumption**, **WUE**, **climate**, and **leakage**.  

## Week 2: Early Sketches & Data Exploration  
- Created first paper sketches of the **Africa map visualization** and potential complementary charts.  
- Tested CSV conversion and initial data cleaning (Python).  
- Drafted axes for WUE comparison by country and by climate region.  

## Week 3: First Visual Prototype  
- Set up project repository and GitHub Pages deployment.  
- Created D3.js v7 base structure (HTML, JS, CSS).  
- Implemented preliminary **choropleth map of Africa** using total energy data.  
- Added tooltip showing detailed energy mix per country.  

## Week 4: Interactivity & Refinement  
- Added interactivity: country selection updates WUE and climate charts dynamically.  
- Designed legends, color scales, and responsive layout.  
- Linked map hover events to secondary visualizations (bar chart, scatterplot).  

## Week 5–6: Validation & Documentation  
- Fine-tuned data alignment between annual energy and hourly weather variables.  
- Tested visualization on multiple browsers and devices.  
- Wrote documentation: `README.md`, `cadrage.md`, `avancement.md`.  
- Added preview images (`teaser.png`, `thumbnail.png`) and metadata for the course gallery submission.  

## Next Steps  
- Add dynamic filtering by energy type and climate region.  
- Integrate WUE trends over time (line chart or animation).  
- Prepare gallery submission and final presentation for January defense.
